I2S GoSPDIF，Based onWM8805，High performance&Bandwidth professionalRS422Buffer DS8921Output

Substrate immersion gold process，Suitable for high-frequency digital signal transmission

I2S GoSPDIF Coaxial，CDMachine to increase coaxial output，Support44.1K，48K，88.2K，96K，176.4K，192KSampling rate，Ultra-low jitter output

There are two output ports A B，You cannot output signal，Use when you need to ensure that

Because the coaxial transmission of digital signal sense of hearing is superior to the optical fiber，So the plate without optical output，According toHIFIConcept design

The clock circuit need not be，It is convenient to change machine reserved expansion location，Can increase the clock，ToCDMachine

## Audiophonics

This I2s to SPDIF interface allows for example to transform an I2S signal coming from a DSP card, a digital source or an audio CD player. Thanks to its Wm8804 receiver interface, it produces a very low jitter.
For the management of the Masterclock MCLK it is necessary to either solder a compatible full size clock or to input an external MCLK through the I2S input. It also has a TTL SPDIF output at 2.7V.
It requires a 5V DC power supply to operate, for example  : DC LT1084 2.5V to 35V 5A.


Compatible clock frequency :

192Khz : 24.576mhz
176.4Khz : 22.5792Mhz
96Khz : 24.576Mhz
88.2Khz : 22.5792Mhz
48Khz : 12.288mhz
44.1Khz : 11.2896Mhz
